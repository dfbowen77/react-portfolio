## Description
The following program is designed to meet the requirements of the module 20 challenge. It represents the beginnings of a web developer's portfolio made using the React front-end framework. The web application was made using JavaScript, React, Bootstrap, Node.js, and Express.js. The portfolio is a single page React application. The initial page is an about me section that contains a brief write up about me. There is a portfolio page that contains links to web development work that I have done previously. A resume section contains information pertaining to my programming skills, work experience, and education. It also contains a link to a downloadable .pdf copy of my resume. Finally, a contact me page has been created which has a form that allows for users to submit their name, email, and a brief message to me. All three fields are validated to ensure the content is appropriate.
